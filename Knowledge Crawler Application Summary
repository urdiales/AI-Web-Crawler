# Knowledge Crawler: AI-Powered Web Knowledge Base Builder

## Overview

Knowledge Crawler is a sophisticated application that transforms web content into structured knowledge for AI-powered retrieval and conversation. It combines advanced web crawling techniques with local Large Language Models (LLMs) to create a powerful knowledge management system that helps users extract, organize, and interact with web-based information.

## Core Components

### 1. Advanced Web Crawler with Filtering

The application uses Crawl4AI to intelligently navigate through websites, exploring content with a breadth-first search approach that ensures comprehensive coverage. The crawler can:

- Navigate to a configurable depth within websites
- Focus on specific keywords or content types
- Filter out navigation elements, social media links, and other non-essential content
- Process SharePoint sites with authentication
- Handle modern web features like lazy-loaded images and infinite scroll

### 2. Structured Knowledge Processing

After crawling, web content undergoes sophisticated processing:

- HTML is cleaned and converted to structured Markdown
- Content is intelligently filtered to focus on meaningful text
- Images are downloaded and processed
- Text is organized into logical sections
- JSON structure is created for semantic representation
- Vector embeddings are generated for semantic search capabilities

### 3. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) System

The application includes a full RAG implementation:

- Local embedding model for vector creation
- FAISS vector database for efficient similarity search
- Integration with Ollama for local language model inference
- Context retrieval system that pulls relevant information for queries
- Streaming response generation

### 4. User-Friendly Interface

A clean, professional Streamlit interface makes the application accessible:

- Web crawler configuration with advanced options
- Knowledge chat interface for interacting with crawled content
- Customizable with company logo
- Export options for JSON and Markdown
- Recent crawls management

### 5. Containerized Deployment

The entire system is containerized for easy deployment:

- Docker and Docker Compose configuration
- Integration with Ollama for local LLM hosting
- Optional GPU acceleration
- Simple 3-step deployment process

## Technical Highlights

1. **Modular Architecture**: The application is built with clear separation of concerns, making it maintainable and extensible.

2. **Asynchronous Processing**: Uses asyncio for efficient concurrent operations during crawling and processing.

3. **Robust Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for network issues, rate limits, authentication problems, and more.

4. **Intelligent Content Selection**: Advanced algorithms to identify and extract meaningful content while removing boilerplate.

5. **Local AI Processing**: Fully functional with local models, no cloud API dependencies required.

## Use Cases

1. **Documentation Knowledge Base**: Create searchable knowledge bases from documentation websites.

2. **SharePoint Content Extraction**: Extract and organize content from corporate SharePoint sites.

3. **Research Aggregation**: Collect and analyze content from multiple research sources.

4. **Website Data Analysis**: Extract structured data from websites for analysis.

5. **Local RAG System**: Create a privacy-focused, offline-capable retrieval system for specific domains.

## Summary

Knowledge Crawler represents a complete end-to-end solution for transforming web content into structured, queryable knowledge. It combines the best of web crawling technology with modern AI techniques, all in a user-friendly package that can be deployed with minimal technical expertise.
